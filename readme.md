## Outline
- loop (repeats code)
- 3 kinds
- for loop (basic)
- while loop
- for each
- for loop (details)
  - use <, <=, >
  - i++
- while loop prime
- break


- for loop
  - parts
    - start, end, increment
    - (++ is the same as +1)
    - in Java we almost always start at 0
    - body
  - circle
  - counting backwards
- while loop
  - parts
    - condition
    - body
  - prime
  - break
- for each loop
  - debug
  - parts


real break example

## Examples
#### Basic for loop
* Draw 10 circles
* What position is the letter "G" in the alphabet?
* Print the first 10 names
* Calculate interest compound annually
* Print the alphabet (use counter variable)
* Draw a clock (different range limits)
* Draw a line (different range limits)
* Print list with numbers (use counter + off by 1)
* Countdown to liftoff (counting backwards)
* Draw a chess board

##### Mistakes
* comma vs semicolon
* wrong number of dots (<= vs <)
* wrong number of dots (1 instead of 0)

#### Basic while loop
* How many licks?
* Ask until valid number (prime)
* read a file

#### Basic for each loop
* Find all the blue circles
* Count the blue circles
* Turn all the circles green
* Eraise all the circles

#### For each using for loop
* Print list with numbers
* Sum a list of numbers
* Find the largest number
* Concatenate list of strings

#### Advanced Scenarios
* top 5 names starting with "J"
